    "# Pushing a repo to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few days, you produced some pieces of code that are worth to be shared ! In this exercise, you will be guided through the different steps allowing to push your code to a public Github repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a new repository on Github\n",
    "To do so, you can go to https://github.com/new (from the homepage, you can also click on the \"new\" button in the repositories section). Then follow these steps to configure your repository :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose a name (pick something that sums up what will be inside, avoid names like \"project1\" or \"test\")\n",
    "* Choose the access level : public or private. If your project is still ongoing, we advise you to make the repository private. You'll be able to make it public at any time, for example once you're satisfied with your code and if you'd like to share it as part of your portfolio.\n",
    "* Select \"initialize this repository with a README\". This will create a Markdown file *README.md* at the root of your repository. This file will be displayed by default on Github's homepage of the repository. Later, you will be able to update this file with pieces of information such as : a description of your project, instructions about how to install and execute your code, a link to the dataset you used, and external resources (links to the external libraries you used, scientific articles, tutorials, blogposts, etc...). We'll take some time later in this lecture to teach you how to edit Markdown files.\n",
    "* In the \"add .gitignore\" drop-down menu, select \"Python\". This will create a *.gitignore* hidden text file that will help Git automatically ignore files and directories that don't contain useful content (for example, the backup files that are created by Jupyter and that are stored in a *.ipynb_checkpoints* directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed all this steps, you can click on \"create repository\". You will then be redirected to the homepage of the repository. You can click on the \"clone or download\" green button in the top right corner and copy the url of your repository to your clipboard (the url that ends with \".git\") so you can use it together with the `git clone` command to download the repository to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a local copy of the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "On Github : go to your new repository's homepage and click on the \"clone or download\" green button, then copy the url of your repository to you clipboard (check that the url ends with the \".git\" extension)\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal :\n",
    "* Use the commands `pwd`, `cd` and `ls` to navigate in your filesystem and go wherever you would like to store the repository\n",
    "* Type `git clone url_to_your_repository.git` (replace url_to_your_repository.git by the url you just copied)\n",
    "* Use the terminal commands to check that the repository has been downloaded and that it contains a file named `README.md`\n",
    "* Before continuing with this exercise, make sure your working directory is the repository you just downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manage changes in the repository with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add a new file in the local repository and add it to the tracked files\n",
    "\n",
    "* Type `git status` : you'll read a sentence \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\" which means that Git hasn't detected any modification in the repository yet \n",
    "* Use the terminal commands to create a copy of yesterday's exercise `01b-Calculate_interests.ipynb` in the repository.\n",
    "* Type `git status` : now you'll read \"nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\", which means that Git has detected a new file (that will appear in red)\n",
    "* To track changes in this file, type `git add 01b-Calculate_interests.ipynb` (or `git add .` this later meaning \"add all files located in the working directory\")\n",
    "* Type again `git status` : the file appears now in green and you can read \"Changes to be committed\". Now you're ready for your first commit !\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your first commit\n",
    "\n",
    "To save the history of changes in the file you just added, type :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -m \"add new notebook with solutions to exercise on interests\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### More commits\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open your notebook and make a few changes (you can for example, use markdown syntax to add some titles)\n",
    "* Save your notebook\n",
    "* Repeat the previous steps with `git add` and `git commit` to save the history of changes\n",
    "* Type `git log` : you'll see the list of commits you've made\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Push to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "Just type :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then go to your remote repository's homepage on Github, and check that your notebook is now online. Try to find the history of commmits on Github's interface."
